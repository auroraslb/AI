# AI

This is the result of a team project in an artificial intelligence class at IST Lisbon.

The project consisted of three assignments.
1. Solve the local 3D point cloud assignment using ICP
2. Solve the global problem, by searching for a solution only using uninformed search.
3. The same as the second assignment, only here there was a certain number of outliers. Also, we were to use informed search algorithms.

Installation guide:
1. Clone this git-repo to your computer
2. Create a virtual environment by calling the command "python3 -m venv virtual-env"
3. Activate the environment by calling "source virtual-env/bin/activate"
4. Install requirements for the project by calling "python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt"
